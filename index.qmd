# The Reading Club {.unnumbered}


![](img/ROS_front)

<br>

This is a Notebook around **Regression and Other Stories** by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. The book is available at <https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/>. The notesbook is available at <https://github.com/Jonkman1/Regression_reading_club_NSCR>. 

This Notebook is part of the **NSC-R Workshops**. The NSC-R Workshops is a series of one-hour online instructional sessions to support participants in developing their data science skills in R, and to promote open science principles. The NSC-R workshop meetings are organized by a team mostly affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR), but they are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level.

There are workshops on specific topics and Tidy Tuesday workshops that cover more basic skills and materials. A collection of these latter workshop materials have been brought together by Harrie Jonkman in a single document that you can find [here](https://ttbook.netlify.app/).

Starting November 2023 we are transforming the workshops on specific topics into a reading group, where we explore the world of data analysis using the book *Regression and Other Stories* by Gelman, Hill and Vehtari as a source of inspiration. Click [here](https://nscrweb.netlify.app/posts/2023-11-14-nsc-r-workshop-ros/) for more information.

In this Notebook you find short summaries of the chapters of the ROS-book and presentations of these chapters by different chairs. The content of the Notebook will grow over time.
