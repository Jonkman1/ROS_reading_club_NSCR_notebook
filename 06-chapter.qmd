## Summary
At a pure mathematical level, the methods described in this book have two purposes:   \
- **prediction** (regression to predict an outcome variable, or more precisely the distribution of the outcome, given some set of inputs);   \
- **comparison** (comparing predictions for different values of the inputs, to make simple comparisons between groups, or to estimate causal effects (see chapters 18-21).

In this chapter:   \
- the favored technique of fake-data simulation is used to **understand** a simple regression;    \
- with using an example (height and earnings) **warning** agains unwarranted causal interpretations;   \
- **historical origins of regression** are discussed ;   \
